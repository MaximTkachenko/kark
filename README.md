[How to Play Carcassonne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d89u-gXjIVY)

This project was created 3 years ago as an experiment with [phaserjs](https://phaser.io/) framework to create browser game. In last update I removed all C# code used for backend and now it's js-only game. Some things should be done here to improve it:
- separate files for react components
- update react version
- add js modules and webpack
- some refactorings should be done also because I wrote most of logic more than 2 years ago.

Folders:
- src\Assets - images
- src\Content - css files
- src\Scripts\app - application code
- src\Scripts\app\test - tests

Files:
- index.html - run it in browser to start a new game
- jasmine-spec-runner.html - run it in browser to run jasmine tests
